# Tic-Tac-Toe
Discription:
This C++ program is a Tic Tac Toe game with user registration, login, and win tracking. The game allows two players to register with unique usernames and passwords, or log in if they have already registered. The game board is displayed, and players take turns placing 'X' and 'O' in a 3Ã—3 grid.
Key Features:
User Registration & Login: Players must register or log in before playing. Credentials are stored in files (userdata1.txt, userdata2.txt).
Win Tracking: The number of wins for each player is recorded and displayed upon login.
Game Logic: The game checks for a winner after each move and detects a draw if all spaces are filled.
File Handling: Uses text files to store and update user data and win counts.
This implementation ensures a persistent gaming experience, where users can track their past wins.
